# Java Debugging
Welcome to the Java debugging workshop repo! The aim of this task is to get you more familiar with the java debugger by 
finding and fixing some bugs in this project. 

## The Project
The main class project is Atm.java which defines possible actions you could define with an ATM.
This includes checking an accounts balance, withdrawing and depositing money, and transferring money to another account.
There is also an AccountService.java class which keeps track of different accounts that have been registered in the system.

## Your Task
You will find test files for the Atm and AccountsService classes with tests for the different methods. Some of these 
tests are currently failing due to bugs in the code. Your job is to use the debugger to find where things are going 
wrong, and fix the bugs.

You should be able to make the tests pass without making any changes to the test classes at all. Good luck!
